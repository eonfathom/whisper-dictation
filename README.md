# Vox

Push-to-talk dictation for **Linux and Windows**. Hold **Ctrl+Win** to record, release to transcribe and paste the result wherever your cursor is.

Uses [faster-whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper) for local, offline speech-to-text with GPU acceleration. Inspired by [Whisper Writer](https://github.com/savbell/whisper-writer) but built as a lightweight, single-file alternative that just works with minimal setup.

## Features

- **Global push-to-talk** — works in any window (evdev on Linux, pynput on Windows)
- **Cross-platform** — one script runs on Linux/X11 and Windows
- **Auto device detection** — CUDA if an NVIDIA GPU is present, otherwise CPU (`int8`) — no config needed
- **Clipboard paste** — pastes instead of simulating keystrokes, for instant output
- **Personal dictionary** — biases Whisper toward your vocabulary and auto-corrects misheard terms (`dictionary.json`)
- **Filler word removal** — strips "um", "uh", "you know", "I mean", etc.
- **Punctuation** — uses an initial prompt to encourage proper punctuation from Whisper
- **Terminal-aware (Linux)** — detects terminal emulators and uses Ctrl+Shift+V automatically
- **Autostart** — run on login (desktop entry on Linux, Startup shortcut on Windows)

## Requirements

**All platforms:** Python 3.10+. An NVIDIA GPU with CUDA is optional — it's auto-detected, and the app falls back to CPU otherwise.

**Linux:**
- X11 (Wayland is not supported — xdotool requires X11)
- System packages: `xdotool`, `xclip`, `xprop`
- User must be in the `input` group (for global hotkey capture via evdev)

**Windows:**
- Windows 10/11 — no special permissions or groups required
- Python packages `pynput` and `pyperclip` (installed automatically)

## Installation (Linux)

```bash
# Install system dependencies
sudo apt install xdotool xclip x11-utils python3-venv

# Add yourself to the input group (required for global hotkeys)
sudo usermod -aG input $USER
# Log out and back in for group change to take effect

# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/eonfathom/vox.git
cd vox
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

The installer creates a venv at `~/.local/share/vox/venv/`, installs dependencies, creates a launcher at `~/.local/bin/vox`, and sets up autostart on login.

## Installation (Windows)

```powershell
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/eonfathom/vox.git
cd vox

# Install: creates a venv, installs deps, adds GPU libraries if an NVIDIA GPU is present
.\install-windows.ps1

# ...or install and also run automatically on login:
.\install-windows.ps1 -Autostart
```

If PowerShell blocks the script, allow it for your user once:
`Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned`

The installer auto-detects your GPU. On an NVIDIA machine it installs the CUDA libraries (cuBLAS, cuDNN, cudart) and runs on the GPU; on an Intel-only laptop it installs the CPU build and the app uses `int8` on the CPU automatically — the same code, no config changes.

## Usage

**Linux:**
```bash
vox          # or it starts automatically on login
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
.\run-windows.ps1          # or starts on login if installed with -Autostart
```

Then, on either platform:
1. Hold **Ctrl+Win** — recording starts
2. Speak
3. Release **Ctrl+Win** — audio is transcribed and pasted at your cursor

## Managing Vox

Vox runs windowless, so use the bundled control script from the repo folder:

```powershell
.\vox.ps1 restart   # reload after editing dictionary.json (also: start / stop / status / guard)
```

`stop` frees the model's VRAM if you need the GPU for something else; `start` brings it back. If PowerShell blocks it: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\vox.ps1 restart`.

**Self-healing:** `.\vox.ps1 guard` runs a guardian loop that starts Vox and restarts it within ~20 s if it ever dies (with crash-storm backoff and duplicate-instance cleanup, logged to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\vox\guardian.log`). Point your Startup shortcut at `wscript.exe "<repo>\vox-guard.vbs"` (which runs the guardian with zero console flash at login - aiming the shortcut at powershell directly flashes a window even with `-WindowStyle Hidden`) and dictation becomes unkillable across crashes. `stop` stops the guardian too, so a deliberate stop stays stopped.

## Configuration

Configuration is via environment variables.

- Linux: set them in your shell profile or before launching.
- Windows: set them before launching, e.g. `$env:VOX_MODEL = "large-v3"` then `.\run-windows.ps1`.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `VOX_MODEL` | auto | `large-v3` on a CUDA GPU, `base` on CPU. Override with `tiny`/`base`/`small`/`medium`/`large-v3` |
| `VOX_LANG` | `en` | Language code (`en`, `es`, `fr`, …) or empty for auto-detect |
| `VOX_HOTKEY` | `ctrl+win` | Push-to-talk chord; `+`-joined modifiers from `ctrl`, `alt`, `win`, `shift` |
| `VOX_MIC` | system default | Input device by name (as listed in the tray's Microphone menu, e.g. `Headset (Glasses_4743)`). Easier: pick it from the tray — the choice persists per machine in `settings.local.json`, and an absent device falls back to the system default. Use the tray's "Rescan devices" after connecting a Bluetooth/USB mic mid-session |
| `VOX_BEAM` | `5` | Decoding beam width; higher = more accurate, a bit slower. Use `1` on a slow CPU |
| `VOX_RELEASE_TAIL` | `0.2` | Seconds to keep recording after release so trailing words aren't clipped |
| `VOX_PAD` | `0.15` | Seconds of trailing silence padded onto the buffer so Whisper finalizes the last segment |
| `VOX_DEVICE` | auto | Auto-detected: `cuda` if a GPU is present, else `cpu`. Override with `cuda`/`cpu`. |
| `VOX_COMPUTE` | auto | `float16` on GPU, `int8` on CPU. Override with `float16`/`int8`/`float32`. |
| `VOX_DICT` | `dictionary.json` | Path to the personal dictionary file |
| `VOX_STRIP_PHANTOMS` | `1` | Strip hallucinated trailing hotword echoes from the transcript. Set `0` to disable |
| `VOX_RESTARTS` | `1` | Collapse verbatim sentence restarts ("we need the, we need the plan" → "we need the plan") without an LLM. `0` to disable |
| `VOX_SMARTCASE` | `1` | Insertion-aware casing (Windows): reads the text around the caret (UI Automation, app-dependent; falls back to vox's own last paste) so dictating mid-sentence doesn't start with a capital, glue words together, or split the sentence with a period. `0` to disable |
| `VOX_HUD` | `1` | Floating dictation HUD (Windows): a click-through overlay pinned above the taskbar at the bottom-right of the monitor you're dictating into — a red plus, live elapsed timer, and mic level meter while you hold the chord; then a release-to-paste latency clock and a brief `words · tokens` result flash. `0` to disable |
| `VOX_HUD_ANCHOR` | `corner` | `caret` anchors to the text insertion point where the OS exposes it (static fallback elsewhere); `cursor` follows the mouse live |
| `VOX_LOG` | auto | Diagnostic log file (rotating, 512 KB × 2). Default `%LOCALAPPDATA%\vox\vox.log` (Linux: `~/.local/state/vox/vox.log`); set a path to move it or `0` to disable |
| `VOX_TRANSCRIPT_DIR` | unset | Directory (e.g. an Obsidian folder) for a per-day markdown record of everything you dictate (`YYYY-MM-DD vox.md`, one `- **HH:MM** text` bullet per dictation). Unset = off |
| `VOX_LLM` | `off` | Optional LLM cleanup pass. `local` = a local OpenAI-compatible server (Ollama; offline, no API key); `anthropic` = Claude via API (needs `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`); a comma list (`anthropic,local`) is a preference chain — backends race in parallel and the earliest-listed success wins, so cloud quality degrades to local automatically when offline |
| `VOX_LLM_MODEL` | `qwen3:4b-instruct` (local) / `claude-haiku-4-5` (anthropic) | Model per backend. With a chain, a comma list aligned by position (`claude-haiku-4-5,qwen3:4b-instruct`); unset positions use the per-backend defaults. The local default is the smallest model that reliably rewrites spoken self-corrections (see benchmark note in `dictation.py`); warm ~0.7–1.2s even on CPU |
| `VOX_LLM_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1` | Local server's OpenAI-compatible base URL (Ollama default; works with LM Studio, llama.cpp `--api`, etc.). Use `127.0.0.1`, not `localhost` — on Windows the latter stalls ~2s per request on IPv6 fallback |
| `VOX_LLM_KEEPALIVE` | `30m` | Keep the local model resident between dictations so there's no reload latency (Ollama) |

Example — force the tiny model on CPU:

```bash
# Linux
VOX_MODEL=tiny VOX_DEVICE=cpu vox
```
```powershell
# Windows
$env:VOX_MODEL="tiny"; $env:VOX_DEVICE="cpu"; .\run-windows.ps1
```

### Optional: LLM cleanup (Wispr-style polish)

By default Vox types the raw (offline) transcript. For Wispr-Flow-style polish — grammar, punctuation, removed filler, spoken commands like "new paragraph" / "scratch that", spoken self-corrections ("…push to main or… sorry, submit a pull request" pastes as just the corrected version; "never mind, what I meant is…" keeps only the replacement), and merged mid-thought pauses (Whisper's spurious "…edit a little bit. With Vox…" becomes one sentence again) — enable an LLM pass. Two backends, usable alone or chained:

**Local (recommended — fully offline, no API key, low latency).** Runs against a local [Ollama](https://ollama.com) server on your own GPU:

```powershell
winget install Ollama.Ollama       # once
ollama pull qwen3:4b-instruct      # small, fast, handles self-corrections
setx VOX_LLM local
```

Restart Vox. It POSTs the raw transcript to the local OpenAI-compatible endpoint (`VOX_LLM_URL`, default Ollama at `127.0.0.1:11434/v1`) using only the Python standard library — no extra package to install. A warm pass is well under a second on a GPU and **~0.7–1.2s on a fast CPU** (measured on a Core Ultra 9); the model is pre-loaded at startup and stays resident (`VOX_LLM_KEEPALIVE`) so there's no per-dictation reload. Point `VOX_LLM_URL` at LM Studio or `llama.cpp --api` instead if you prefer. Model choice matters more than size here — pick one that *follows instructions* (returns cleaned text) rather than *chats back*; `qwen3:4b-instruct` is the tested default and the smallest model that handles mid-sentence self-corrections, including either/or retractions ("…push to main or… sorry, submit a pull request") that `qwen2.5:3b-instruct` refuses at any prompt. Avoid `llama3.2:3b` — it tends to reply to the transcript instead of cleaning it.

**Anthropic (cloud).** Highest quality, needs a key and internet:

```powershell
setx ANTHROPIC_API_KEY sk-ant-...
setx VOX_LLM anthropic
```

This uses the official `anthropic` SDK (`pip install anthropic`), fast **Haiku** by default (~$0.001 per dictation).

**Chained (best of both — cloud quality online, local on a plane):**

```powershell
setx ANTHROPIC_API_KEY sk-ant-...
setx VOX_LLM anthropic,local
```

A comma-separated `VOX_LLM` is a preference chain: every dictation fires all backends in parallel under the same latency budget, and the earliest-listed one that succeeds wins. When the cloud is unreachable — plane, outage, missing key — that attempt fails in milliseconds and the local result, already in flight, serves the paste instead. No mode switching, no config change mid-flight.

Every configuration is **fully fail-safe**: no server/key, no internet, a timeout, or any error falls back to the raw transcript, so a dictation is never lost. Your personal `dictionary.json` corrections still run last, so brand terms like Rokid always survive.

### Model size guide

| Model | Speed | Accuracy | VRAM | Good for |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `tiny` | Fastest | Good for clear speech | ~1 GB | Weak CPUs |
| `base` | Fast | Good balance | ~1 GB | Default on CPU-only machines |
| `small` | Moderate | Better accuracy | ~2 GB | CPU laptops wanting accuracy |
| `medium` | Slow | High accuracy | ~5 GB | Mid-range GPUs |
| `large-v3` | Slowest | Best accuracy | ~3 GB (fp16) | Default on any CUDA GPU |

On a CPU-only laptop, stick to `base` or `small`. On a GPU with 10 GB+ VRAM, `large-v3` gives the best accuracy at no real speed cost.

## Personal dictionary

Names, jargon, and product names that Whisper mishears go in `dictionary.json`:

```json
{
  "hotwords": ["Eon", "Obsidian", "Claude Code"],
  "corrections": { "clod code": "Claude Code", "obsidion": "Obsidian" }
}
```

- **`hotwords`** bias Whisper *during* recognition so it's more likely to hear your terms correctly.
- **`corrections`** are a whole-word, case-insensitive find/replace applied *after* transcription — a safety net for anything it still gets wrong.

Edit the file and restart the app to reload.

## Troubleshooting

### No text appears (Linux)

Check your default audio input — if you have multiple devices, the wrong one may be selected:
```bash
wpctl status                    # list audio sources
wpctl set-default <source-id>   # set the correct mic
```

### "No keyboards found" (Linux)

Add yourself to the `input` group, then log out and back in:
```bash
sudo usermod -aG input $USER
```

### Nothing happens / CUDA errors (Windows)

- **First run is slow** — it downloads the model (~140 MB for `base`, ~1.5 GB for the GPU default `large-v3`) and warms up CUDA.
- **`cublas64_12.dll ... cannot be loaded`** — the CUDA libraries aren't installed. Run `.\install-windows.ps1` again, or `pip install nvidia-cublas-cu12 nvidia-cudnn-cu12 nvidia-cuda-runtime-cu12` into the venv. The app adds these to the DLL search path automatically at startup.
- **Pastes into the wrong place** — the text is pasted into whatever window has focus when you release Ctrl+Win. Keep your cursor where you want the text.
- **Windows key opens the Start menu** — releasing the Win key on its own can pop the Start menu. Press Ctrl a moment before Win, or choose another chord: `VOX_HOTKEY=ctrl+alt` (or `ctrl+shift`).
- **No GPU?** That's fine — it runs on CPU automatically. Use `VOX_MODEL=base` or `small` for reasonable speed.

### Slow transcription

- Use a smaller model: `VOX_MODEL=tiny` (or `base`/`small` on CPU).
- Confirm the device: the startup banner prints `Device: cuda` or `Device: cpu`.

## Uninstall

**Linux:** `./uninstall.sh`

**Windows:** delete the repo folder and remove the `Vox` shortcut from your Startup folder (`shell:startup`) if you enabled autostart.

## How it works

1. Keyboard events are captured globally — **evdev** on Linux, **pynput** on Windows (no window focus required)
2. When Ctrl+Win are both held, audio recording starts via **sounddevice**
3. On release, the audio buffer is passed to **faster-whisper** for transcription (CUDA if available, else CPU)
4. The transcript is cleaned: filler words stripped, then personal-dictionary corrections applied
5. The result is copied to the clipboard and pasted — **xdotool** on Linux (Ctrl+V, or Ctrl+Shift+V in terminals), **pynput** on Windows (Ctrl+V)

## Comparison with Whisper Writer

This project was inspired by [Whisper Writer](https://github.com/savbell/whisper-writer). Here's how they compare:

| | Vox | Whisper Writer |
|---|---|---|
| **Architecture** | Single file | ~12 source files, full PyQt5 GUI |
| **Dependencies** | A handful of Python packages | 69 Python packages |
| **Text output** | Clipboard paste (instant) | Keystroke simulation (slow, known bugs with duplicated/missing chars) |
| **Post-processing** | Filler removal, punctuation cleanup, personal dictionary | Trailing space/period removal only |
| **Recording modes** | Hold-to-record | Continuous, VAD, press-to-toggle, hold-to-record |
| **Hotkey** | Ctrl+Win, configurable via `VOX_HOTKEY` (evdev on Linux, pynput on Windows) | Configurable chord (evdev or pynput) |
| **Configuration** | Environment variables + `dictionary.json` | YAML config + settings GUI |
| **STT backend** | faster-whisper (local) | faster-whisper (local) + OpenAI API |
| **Platforms** | Linux/X11 + Windows | Linux, macOS, Windows |
| **GPU** | CUDA with auto-fallback to CPU | CUDA with auto-fallback to CPU |

**Why this project exists:** Vox trades flexibility for simplicity and reliability — clipboard paste is faster and more reliable than keystroke simulation, the single-file design has no complex dependency chains, and filler-word removal plus a personal dictionary produce cleaner output. If you want something that just works on Linux or Windows with minimal setup, this is for you.
