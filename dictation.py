Vox - Hold Ctrl+Win, speak, release to type.

Cross-platform push-to-talk dictation (Linux/X11 + Windows). Hold Ctrl+Win to
record, release to stop, transcribe, and paste the result wherever your cursor is.
The chord is configurable via VOX_HOTKEY (e.g. "ctrl+alt", "ctrl+shift").

  Linux   : evdev for global hotkeys, xclip/xdotool for clipboard paste.
            User must be in the 'input' group.
  Windows : pynput for global hotkeys + paste, pyperclip for clipboard.
            No special permissions required.

Speech-to-text is local and offline via faster-whisper. The device is
auto-detected: CUDA if a GPU is available, otherwise CPU (int8).

Requires: faster-whisper, sounddevice, numpy
  Linux:   evdev            (+ system: xdotool, xclip, xprop)
  Windows: pynput, pyperclip

    Pure text-in/text-out (like find_prefetch_cut) so it is trivially

    `protected` is the capitalization-protected vocabulary (defaults to
    HOTWORDS); their leading capitals are never softened. Per boundary:

      1. A trailing ellipsis or dangling dash on the left side is Whisper
         marking "trailed off mid-thought" at the cut - drop it, the thought
         continues in the next segment ("Include things that... | Gretchen
         said" -> "Include things that Gretchen said"). The right side then
         falls through to rule 3, so a whitelisted function word loses its
         chunk-start capital while a potential name keeps it. (A non-listed
         content word keeps a stray capital - "not that... | Excited" joins
         as "not that Excited" - because text alone cannot tell an adjective
         from a name; the LLM pass owns that cosmetic fix.)
      2. Right side starts lowercase -> it is a continuation (Whisper
         capitalizes genuine sentence starts), so any terminal punctuation
         on the left was false finalization - strip it ("...Halcyon Loans?
         | and whether..." -> "...Halcyon Loans and whether...").
      3. Left side ends mid-sentence (no terminal punctuation) but the right
         starts with a capital -> the capital is chunk-start artifact; undo
         it only for whitelisted function words, never for potential names.
      4. Both sides look finalized (left terminal punctuation, right capital)
         - usually a genuine break, EXCEPT two shapes that cannot be real:
         a right side opening with a never-sentence-initial word ("...for
         section 4. | Which is paragraph 32 through 38 or so."), and a short
         function-word fragment ("...at various caps. | Up to 175") - the
         classic tiny-orphan-sentence artifact. Both merge: strip the left's
         terminal punctuation, soften the right's capital. Anything longer
         or content-word-led is left alone - that ambiguity needs audio (the
         tail-merge re-decode) or semantics (the LLM pass), not heuristics.
